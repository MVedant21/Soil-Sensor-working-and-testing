## Introduction

The sensor helps detecting the NPK values along with soil-moisture, soil-humidity, soil-pH and soil-temperature. The testing of this sensor is achieved with the help of Arduino UNO. 
The code written helps the connected sensor to display the values mentioned above in a specific format.

## Features

The data sensed by the sensor is passed on to the RS-485 modbus which is then connected to the arduino along with appropriate 

## Hardware Components

Flex sensors, Adafruit Analog Accelerometer: ADXL335, PCB board, wires, HC - 05 bluetooth module, Arduino NANO, glove, zip-tags, soldering machine, Resistor 10k ohm.

## Software Requirements

The code required is written in Arduino Ide.

## Usage

The primary objective of this device is to empower those facing visibility challenges by providing them with a convenient and effective means of expressing themselves through sign language, ultimately enhancing their communication experience. People with visibility aid can be taught these movements in order to communicate what they want as an alternative for Braille Script. They can listen to the output coming from the device which is connected to the bluetooth module via the app.
