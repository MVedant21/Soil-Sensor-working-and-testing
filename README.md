## Introduction

This device is designed to seamlessly translate hand movements in American Sign Language (ASL) into numbers and letters, facilitating effortless communication for individuals with visual impairments. 
The primary objective of this device is to empower those facing visibility challenges by providing them with a convenient and effective means of expressing themselves through sign language, ultimately enhancing their communication experience.

## Features

The data of Flex sensors along with Gyroscope/Accelerometer was collected to classify each number and letter independently. 
Th unique positions of each and every finger along with the position of the palm leads to a different letter or a number.
Enables people to communicate with just hand and finger movements, thus helping the disabled.
The communication happens via bluetooth connection to the user's device.

## Hardware Components

Flex sensors, Adafruit Analog Accelerometer: ADXL335, PCB board, wires, HC - 05 bluetooth module, Arduino NANO, glove, zip-tags, soldering machine, Resistor 10k ohm.

## Software Requirements

The code required is written in Arduino Ide.

## Usage

The primary objective of this device is to empower those facing visibility challenges by providing them with a convenient and effective means of expressing themselves through sign language, ultimately enhancing their communication experience. People with visibility aid can be taught these movements in order to communicate what they want as an alternative for Braille Script. They can listen to the output coming from the device which is connected to the bluetooth module via the app.
